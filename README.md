# ROSCon 2022 workshop on ros2_control

Thank you for your interest in ros2_control.
This repository is developed with a purpose of supporting workshop on *ros2_control* @ ROSCon2022 in Kyoto, Japan.
Regardless if you could or could not participate the repository will provide you with detailed instruction on how utilize *ros2_control* framework and explain functionality and purpose of its individual parts.

### Installing this repository

After cloning the repository, go to your source workspace and execute following command to install all dependencies:
```
vcs import -input roscon2022_control_workshop/roscon2022_workshop.repos .
rosdep update
rosdep install -y -i --from-paths .
```

## What is *ros2_control*

Simply, ros2_control is a control framework for ROS2.
But actually, it is much more, it is kernel of ROS2 system that controls robots:
 - it abstracts hardware and low-level control for other framework like MoveIt2 and Nav2;
 - it provide resource access management,
 - controls theirs lifecycle and so on.

## Structure of this repository (and workshop)

The structure of the repository follows the flow of integrating robots with ROS2 and those are the following steps:

1. üìë Setting up hardware description for *ros2_control*

   1. üóí Setting up URDF using XACRO for a robot
   2. üìù Extending robot's URDF with `<ros2_control>` tag

2. üñ• Using *Mock Hardware* plugin for simple and generic testing of the setup (and how it can save you ton of time and nerves)

   1. üõ† How to setup *Mock Hardware* for a robot?
   2. üî© How to test it with a of-the-shelf controller?

3. ‚öô Getting know the roles of the main components of *ros2_control* framework: *Controller Manager*, *Controllers*, *Resource Manager* and *Hardware Interface* -- 30 min

4. üî¨ Introspection of *ros2_control* system

5. üíª Simulating your hardware using Gazebo Classic and Gazebo

6. üîÉ Getting familiar with the lifecycle of controllers and hardware and how to use it

7. ü§ñ How to write a hardware interface for a robot

8. üõÇ How to write a controller

9. üîó Reusing standard controller and creating controller-chains

10. ‚ôª Modular reuse of hardware drivers for complex systems

11. ü§ñü§ñü§ñ Managing multiple robots with ros2_control

12. üëë Dr. Denis' Tips:

    1. üíâ Parameter injection
    2. ‚öñ Typical setup of robots and it packages

## Details about the workshop

### 1. üìë Setting up hardware description for *ros2_control*

##### GOAL

  - learn how to setup URDF for a robot using XACRO macros
  - learn what URDF changes are needed to integrate a robot with `ros2_control`


##### üóí Setting up URDF using XACRO for a robot

For any robot that is used with ROS/ROS2 URDF description is needed.
This description holds information about kinematics, visualization (e.g., for Rviz2) and collision data.
This description is are also used by popular ROS2 high-level libraries like, MoveIt2, Nav2 and Simulators.

In this excercise we will focus on setting up the description using XACRO format which is highly configurable and parameterizable and generally better to use then static URDF format.

**For the description file create `contrlko_description` package**

##### Task

Branch: `1-robot-description/task`

**Task 1** Setup the XACRO for RRbot in a new package called

Kinematics:

  - 2 DoF
  - 1st joint is on a podest (box 30x30x30 cm) 30 cm above the ground and rotates around the axis orthogonal to the ground
  - 1st link ist 50cm long (cylinder with 20cm diameter)
  - 2nd joint is rotation orthogonal to the first link's height
  - 2nd link is 60cm long  (10x10cm cross-section 5x5cm)

Hardware:

  - Force Torque Sensor at TCP (6D)
  - 2 digital inputs and output (outputs can be measured)

References:

  - https://wiki.ros.org/urdf
  - https://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML

Files to create or adjust:

  - `rrbot_macro.xacro` - macro with kinematics and geometries for the `rrbot`
  - `rrbot.urdf.xacro` - main xacro file for the robot where macro is instantiated
  - `view_robot.launch.py` - loading and showing robot in `rviz2`


**TIPP**: `RosTeamWS` tool has some scripts that can help you to solve this task faster (on the branch is this already implemented). Resources:

##### üóí Setting up URDF using XACRO for a robot

TODO: Add example of the `ros2_control` tag.

Create XACRO macro file with `<ros2_control>` tag and add to it:

1. two joints with `position` command interface and `position`, `velocity` and `acceleration` state interfaces.
2. one senosor called `tcp_fts_sensor` with six state interfaces: `fx`, `fy`, `fz`, `tx`, `ty`, and `tz`; and parameter `frame_id` with value `tool0`.
3. gpio block called `flange_gpios` with two digital inputs and outputs with feedback.

Include the macro file in `rrbot.urdf.xacro`.


Files to create:
  - `rrbot_macro.ros2_control.xacro` - file with the `ros2_control` macro for the `rrbot`

##### Solution:

Branch: `1-robot-description/solution`
Check the files listed above and execute:
```
ros2 launch controlko_description view_rrbot.launch.py
```
to view the robot and move its joins using `Joint State Publisher` GUI.
